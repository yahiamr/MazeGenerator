# p5.js Backtracking Maze Generator

An interactive maze generator using the backtracking algorithm, visualized with the p5.js library.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive way to visualize the backtracking maze generation algorithm. With p5.js, we bring the algorithmic process to life, allowing users to observe and appreciate the intricacies of maze generation.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm Visualization**: Watch as the maze is constructed using the backtracking algorithm, showcasing how the algorithm explores, backtracks, and carves out a path.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust the maze's dimensions, the speed of generation, and other relevant parameters.
- **Interactive Controls**: Pause, resume, or restart the maze generation at any point.
